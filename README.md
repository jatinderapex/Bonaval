# BonaVal Landing Page

This repository hosts the code for the landing and content pages at
www.bonaval.de.

The final version of the content is generated with `jekyll`, to generate
run

    $ jekyll build

The content will be generated into the `_site` subdirectory.

For development, it is helpful to run `$ jekyll serve` which will automatically
re-generate the content after every save.

The HTML chunks are in the `_includes` folder, css, fonts and images are
in the `css`, `fonts`, and `img` folders, respectively.
